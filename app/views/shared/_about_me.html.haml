      just happened to me. And now it is my passion. Now i want to grow and mature as a photographer. Learn
      more at times from my pictures and at times from others. I believe there is always something to capture in the moments
      we live, at times its my heart that captures it and at times its my camera.

      Being a Web and Middleware engineer, life was monotonous and i always had a side for colors and photography. And then,
      I decided to buy a Canon 130SX. That was the beginning of it. Let me know if you like my work.
